# ｅｎｃｏｄｅｉｔｄｅｃｏｄｅｉｔ

A little c++ script wich encodes/decodes input based on a dictionary.

It's only purpose is to be as 🔥 **BLAZING FAST** 🔥 as possible.

Made with ❤ for the Algorithms & Data Structures course at UCC.

## Usage

To run it, simply use these commands

```bash
docker build -t encoder-decoder .
```
```bash
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app/output encoder-decoder 
```

This will run the script and leave behind an md file with some performance information in the directory you ran it.
